Blender Script Library Introduction (English Version)
This is a script library designed for Blender users to streamline workflows, improve efficiency, 和 address common issues related to materials and models. The current version includes the following three practical scripts:
1. Check for Missing Textures

Functionality: Scans all materials in a Blender project to detect and report any missing texture files.
Purpose: Helps users quickly identify missing textures, ensuring complete rendering results and avoiding issues caused by incorrect file paths or missing files.
Features: Supports multiple texture types and provides detailed reports on missing file paths.

2. Remove Models with the Same Appearance

Functionality: Identifies and removes duplicate models in a scene that share the same materials, appearance, or geometry.
Purpose: Optimizes scenes by reducing redundant models, decreasing file size, and improving rendering performance.
Features: Intelligently compares model materials and geometry, with support for user-defined comparison thresholds.

3. Use PNG Library to Fix DDS Loss

Functionality: Uses the PNG library to convert DDS format textures to PNG, addressing quality loss issues in certain DDS files.
Purpose: Ensures texture consistency across different platforms and rendering engines, ideal for projects requiring high-quality texture output.
Features: Automated batch processing, supports lossless conversion, and preserves original texture details.

Usage

Import the script library into Blender’s Python environment.
Call the desired script as needed; scripts support both command-line execution and Blender UI integration.
Detailed documentation and example code can be found in the script library’s README file.

Target Audience

3D artists and modelers
Game developers
Animation and rendering professionals

Future Plans
We plan to continuously expand this script library, adding features such as automated UV map optimization and batch material replacement. User feedback and suggestions are welcome!
